Let's say I want to build a sworm system that is inspired from real life , visible screen is nation, divided into some fraction called as state , have general people (blue coded individual) , general people elect a person as their leader (green) , leaders will elect a person as their leader, supreme leader (yellow) , supreme leader will allocate some task with some fund before their tenure , then honesty, corruption, propaganda etc comes into the picture , can i integrate diffrent types of learning like supervised , unsupervised, reinforcement and the ANN(any of its type) here or the fuzzy logic here , also as the happenings should be visible in screen i want this program to have frontend , backend type logic so how i can construct it using solid and agile methodology , so according to that give a brainstroming , after getting some ideas i will create a lld and many plan.md files for the developement purpose in details , as i will implement this project by ai , plan.md and promt should include the install check of the version and how should i run the backend (as it will include the ml , ann etc so it wont hurt my pc ) containerazation if needed and the plan should be devided into part by part , and for database can i use maria db for now as i dont have postgresql in local setup , but the code should be in such format it should adaptable for mariadb and postgresql














Test the simulation in the browser to verify all Phase 7 features (DQN brains, social feedback, elections)?
Implement Phase 8 from the roadmap (Social Complexity - Factions, Generational Turnover)?
Add more documentation or polish existing features?
Something else you have in mind?


push to the github into my repository , with deviding the whole developement into 8 to 10 commits , commits shold be sceduled in such a format the commits should be look humanly possible to develope in the time span/ days into the commits are being devided

make a strategy based brain selection 
-------------------------
genral people->rule based or small ANN
influencer/activist -> ANN
state leader -> DQN?policy gradient
supreme leader-> DQN+long horizon reward

sould mirror real life cognitive hierarchhhy

additional behaviour 
hope (Economic risk taking), fear(vote suppression) , cognitive bias(irrational voting),
confirmation bias(echo chambers), memory decay(short term thinking)

socio-structure variable
education clusters
reliegion/ideology(as abstract vector)

to crete non linear voting pattern

media n info control
->media owner ship
algorithemic amplification
disinformation rate etc..
for enabling-> narrative warfare

economic feedback loop
inflation
unemployment
blackeconomy
wealth inequality

can stocastisity be added?

use kNN, decision tree , random forest , svm etc where needed to replicate human like rule behaviour 

do something like trust<0.3 AND unemployment > 0.5 -> protest
if leader_honesty > 0.65 -> vote_for

for voting desicion, protest participation, policy acceptance

add logs for rule-based agents , synthetic distribution, scenario based genrator etc..

follow a hybrid structure for each individual i.e
agent brain stack 
perception layer->ml(svm/rf)
decision layer -> tree/ rules
strategic layer -> rl
social layer -> kNN


example for citizen agent 
Input → SVM (ideology)
     → KNN (peer opinion)
     → Decision Tree (vote / protest)

example-> state leader
    Input → RF (risk analysis)
     → DQN (long-term fund allocation)
