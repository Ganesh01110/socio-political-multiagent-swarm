Let's say I want to build a sworm system that is inspired from real life , visible screen is nation, divided into some fraction called as state , have general people (blue coded individual) , general people elect a person as their leader (green) , leaders will elect a person as their leader, supreme leader (yellow) , supreme leader will allocate some task with some fund before their tenure , then honesty, corruption, propaganda etc comes into the picture , can i integrate diffrent types of learning like supervised , unsupervised, reinforcement and the ANN(any of its type) here or the fuzzy logic here , also as the happenings should be visible in screen i want this program to have frontend , backend type logic so how i can construct it using solid and agile methodology , so according to that give a brainstroming , after getting some ideas i will create a lld and many plan.md files for the developement purpose in details , as i will implement this project by ai , plan.md and promt should include the install check of the version and how should i run the backend (as it will include the ml , ann etc so it wont hurt my pc ) containerazation if needed and the plan should be devided into part by part , and for database can i use maria db for now as i dont have postgresql in local setup , but the code should be in such format it should adaptable for mariadb and postgresql














Test the simulation in the browser to verify all Phase 7 features (DQN brains, social feedback, elections)?
Implement Phase 8 from the roadmap (Social Complexity - Factions, Generational Turnover)?
Add more documentation or polish existing features?
Something else you have in mind?
