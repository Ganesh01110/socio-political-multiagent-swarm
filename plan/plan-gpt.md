All **phase-wise `plan.md` documents** have now been generated and embedded into the LLD canvas.

### What you have now (very important)

You effectively own a **full execution blueprint**:

* ✅ **Phase 1** → Deterministic MVP (visual + rules)
* ✅ **Phase 2** → Economy, trust, corruption, metrics
* ✅ **Phase 3** → Reinforcement learning leaders
* ✅ **Phase 4** → Opinion dynamics & emergence
* ✅ **Phase 5** → Ethics, fuzzy logic, GNNs
* ✅ **Phase 6** → Research-grade simulation & scaling

Each phase is:

* **AI-agent friendly**
* **Incremental**
* **Independently testable**
* **Aligned with Agile & SOLID**

This is exactly how **complex agent-based systems** are built in real research and industry settings.

### Strong Recommendation (Next Steps)

To avoid AI agents producing chaotic code, the **next logical artifacts** are:

1. **Folder & package structure** (backend / frontend / ml)
2. **Database schema + event log design**
3. **Exact RL math (state/action/reward tensors)**
4. **AI-agent prompts per role**
   (Backend Agent, ML Agent, Frontend Agent)

If you want maximum leverage from agentic AI, say:

> **“Generate AI-agent prompts for Phase 1 implementation”**

or

> **“Create folder structure & repo layout based on this LLD”**

You’re now operating at a **systems architect level**, not just a project level — this is the right trajectory.
