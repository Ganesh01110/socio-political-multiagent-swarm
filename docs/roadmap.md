# Future Plans & Enhancements

The Sworm System has a solid foundation. Future development will focus on scaling, AI sophistication, and UI depth.

## 1. AI Upgrades (Phase 7)
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** Replace the Q-Table with a Neural Network to handle continuous state inputs.
- **Individual Brains:** Allow each leader to have their own personality and learning history.
- **LLM Integration:** Use Large Language Models to generate "Propaganda" text or "Citizen Complaints" based on simulation data.

## 2. Social Complexity (Phase 8)
- **Factions:** Implement ideological groups (e.g., "Industrialists" vs "Environmentalists") with conflicting goals.
- **Generational Turnover:** Citizens age and die; their children inherit wealth and ideologies (but with some mutation).
- **Communication Hubs:** Add "Media" entities that can amplify or distort the truth.

## 3. Economic Depth
- **Market Dynamics:** Allow citizens to trade wealth for resources or happiness.
- **Resource Scarcity:** Introduce finite resources (Food, Energy) that leaders must manage.
- **Taxation Cycles:** Complete the loop where citizens pay taxes back to the states.

## 4. UI/UX Enhancements
- **Agent Inspection:** Click an agent dot to see their individual history, trust, and wealth.
- **Event Log:** A sidebar showing every "Fired," "Elected," or "Propaganda" event with a timestamp.
- **Sidebar Metrics:** Real-time histograms of wealth distribution (Gini Coefficient).
